## Overview

Welcome to the **Singapore Flat Resale Analysis** project! This project analyzes resale flat data in Singapore to uncover trends in pricing, location-based demand, and other factors influencing the resale market. Through interactive dashboards and data visualizations, this project aims to assist potential buyers, sellers, and policymakers in making data-driven decisions.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze historical resale flat prices and trends across different locations and flat types.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualize resale flat distributions and price variations based on location.
- **Price Prediction**: Machine learning models predict resale prices based on key property attributes.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Explore pricing trends and market insights with Streamlit's interactive visualization tools.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identify trends in resale prices to assist in planning, investment, and policy decisions.
